DAY 1  -  BLOCK CHAIN ASSINGNMENT 
 
 
What  is  your  understanding  of  Block chain ? 
                       It’s a technology. That mix up both disturbuted database and cryptography. It’s a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of transactions in a secure, chronological and immutable way in a decentralized Disturbed network.

Decentralized 
Unchangeable

 
What all things does a block contain ? 
     
Block Number 
Previous block Signature 
New Records 
Mining 
 
How verifiability of Block chain has been attained ? 
            The data is stored across multiple sites throughout the internet. If any discrepancy is observed at a particular site then it can be rectified by verifying data at other sites. In this way verifiability is achieved.                  Data = key0                  key0+New Data = key1                  key1+New Data = key2                  and so on.
